## Purpose: 

The purpose of this application is to facilitate the operation of a hypothetical business that rents out a small fleet of vintage, refurbished camper-vans. It aims to provide a user-friendly platform where customers can conveniently book camper-vans and view their availability in real-time. The application is designed to cover new user registration, profile management, booking logs, availability tracking, and booking confirmation. It is intended to have an inbuilt review system, fostering a transparent and interactive space for customers to share their experiences.

The application is required to be scalable and extensible, built with the potential to integrate additional features or modules in the future, such as search filters, personalised recommendations, payment system, live chat messaging, admin dashboard and an instagram carousel.

## Target Audience: 

The application's target audience is broad and inclusive, designed to cater to anyone with an interest in hiring vintage camper-vans. This could range from individuals planning a unique weekend getaway, families seeking an alternative vacation experience, to aficionados of vintage vehicles who relish the opportunity to experience these refurbished camper-vans.

While the application will be designed with ease of use in mind, it will cater to both tech-savvy users who are comfortable navigating digital platforms, and less tech-oriented individuals who may require a simpler, more intuitive user interface.

<br>
<a name="wfiterations"></a>

## Design Iterations for Wireframes (Agile)

### **Navigation and Flow:**

- Initially, the wireframe design consisted of just a 'Vans' button in the navigation bar, leading users to the vans page for making a booking. Feedback led to the addition of a 'Book Now' button in the navigation bar and a prominently placed one on the home page, providing quicker access to the booking section. This improved the navigation flow by giving users a direct route to start booking a van.

- In the original design, van information was only accessible through the 'Vans' page. To improve user flow, images of the three vans were added as clickable buttons on the home page, leading directly to the respective Van detail pages. This change provided users with a direct path to the details of the van they are interested in.

- The login and create account forms were initially located on the same page, potentially causing confusion for the user. To improve flow, these were split into individual 'Login' and 'Signup' pages, ensuring a more intuitive path for users either returning to the site or signing up for the first time.

- The mobile view initially displayed all vans listed down the Vans page. To streamline the mobile navigation flow, this was replaced with a dropdown menu allowing quick access to individual van details, reducing the number of steps a user would have to take to find information on a specific van.

### **Layout and Positioning:**

- In the initial design of the vans page, the images of the van were displayed in a vertically cascading manner, taking up a lot of space on the page and requiring the user to scroll to see all the content. The layout was revised to include a carousel for the images, consolidating space and making it easier for the user to view other details on the same screen.

- The van details and booking calendar on the vans page were originally positioned so that the calendar was underneath the van details, requiring the user to scroll down to view available dates. To enhance the user experience and reduce scrolling, the layout was adjusted so that the calendar was positioned beside the van details. This allowed users to view the van details and available dates simultaneously.

- Initially, the social media links were located in the top navigation bar. After several iterations, these links were moved to the footer to reduce clutter in the navigation bar and to place more emphasis on other essential navigation links and buttons.

- The reviews section on the home page was initially positioned higher up on the page. After iterating, we realized that this section was not as critical as others to be seen so prominently, so it was moved to the bottom of the page. This also gave higher visibility to other, more critical sections on the home page.


### **Element Design:**

- Initially, there were not as many images of vans and scenic locations on the home page. After several iterations, we decided to add and enlarge these images to help users visualize the idea and concept of the business, providing a glimpse into what a getaway trip with Van Voyage might look like.

- Over time, we shifted the color scheme towards natural, muted hues like greens and beiges. This decision was made to align the website's overall aesthetic more closely with the business's objective of providing nature-focused van trips.

- In the first iteration of the wireframe design, we had a sticky footer. However, given the growing amount of information on the page and the non-essential nature of the footer content, we decided to switch to a non-sticky footer. This change improved the overall user experience by ensuring the most important information was front and center.


### **Adding / Removing Features:**

- Based on early feedback, we realised that users would want to be able to view the booking history easily. Therefore, we added a "Booking History" section to the user's account dashboard instead of it being seen via email. This also meant that we could handle the cancel booking feature here as well.

- For a more intuitive experience, we decided to implement conditional rendering for the Login, Sign Up, Account, and Log Out buttons in the navigation bar. This means that the user will see "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons when they are not logged into the site. Once they log in, these buttons will switch to "Account" and "Log Out". This dynamic adjustment provides a more tailored user experience and intuitively guides users to relevant sections based on their authentication status. 

- The initial design concept included an Instagram carousel at the bottom of the homepage, which aimed to showcase real-time updates and user experiences. It was thought that this would lend authenticity and vibrancy to the website. However, during the process of user feedback and further development, it was determined that this feature wasn't contributing significantly to the overall user experience.

# Planning methodology used (agile):

A project management methodology was implemented to keep the project on track and organised, so that we were on the same page with regards to what we were working on, and what steps we were needing to take next in the build of the application. For our project, we utilised a loose Agile methodology consisting of three short sprints and daily stand-ups. 

Building on from the submission of part A, we built on what we had planned and also removed some features from the MVP for the purpose of keeping the project within scope given the time frame. A Trello board was used, and tasks were allocated. For this project, we both took part in building the back end server of the site, and the frontend client, with our main tasks revolving around the models that we were working with. In this sense, we both would have experience within the majority of aspects of the build, as we were not limited to working on one end of the project. 

Generally, the main tasks outside of configuration and setup were split between The User & Review models and controllers (Jordan), and the Van & booking models and controllers (James). Each member continued their backend builds to the frontend, working with the same models and logic that we had built in the backend. 

Our build plan consisted of three sprints, each lasting one week. We would also have daily stand-ups, where we would inform the other of what we were working on at the moment, what troubles we were encountering, and what we were to work on next. We would also discuss the implementation of certain features and would either add or cut features as necessary. Code was to be reviewed upon every branch merge or implementation of a new feature. A [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/RtrOpaLV/ca-retro-van-hire-part-a) was made with tasks related to each section within the build that needed to be covered. Tasks were assigned with JA and JB to indicate which member was to focus on that task, and importance ratings and due dates were assigned to the cards to align with the planned sprints. 

The layout of the sprints are as follows:

- **Week 1: The backend build**
    - Members were allocated their models and controllers to work on, with both members conducting their own tests in postman.
    - A goal was set for routes to be setup and working as intended by the end of the week.
    - Tasks allocated in Trello.

- **Week 2: The frontend build**
    - The frontend build was done with each member having a primary focus on building out the pages and components that were directly related with the models that were allocated.
    - A goal was set to deploy the client early in the week.
    - A goal was set to have the production server deployed and connected to the client (running in production) by the end of the week.

- **Week 3: Testing and tying up the loose ends**
    - Week 3’s primary focus was testing, as well as going over the assignment and rubric. Week 3 intentionally had a lot of wiggle room in the case that either the backend or frontend build ran into issues resulting in it extending past their allocated one week sprint.

## Planning (Trello):

### [View Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/RtrOpaLV/ca-retro-van-hire-part-a)


To initiate the project planning process, we first set up a Trello board to streamline our project tasks, track progress, and ensure every team member is aligned with the project's objectives. The board was divided into three main categories: To Do, Doing, and Done. These categories provided a clear and concise overview of our work progress at any given point.

We used color-coding for each card to clearly distinguish between different aspects of the project. Blue cards represented frontend-related tasks, Green was used for the database tasks, Turquoise was assigned to backend tasks, Orange was used for project's Part A tasks, and Red was designated for any questions or reminders that came up during the project lifecycle. The color coding system allowed us to quickly grasp the nature of the tasks at a glance.

Labels were another key feature we used to add an extra layer of categorization within the color-coded cards. These labels indicated whether the task involved Coding (Orange label), Planning (Green label), Documentation (Blue label), or corresponded to a specific Rubric (Red label). Labels helped us understand the type of work required for each task, irrespective of its nature (frontend, backend, or database).

In order to maintain a smooth workflow and meet our deadlines, we set due dates for each card. This not only helped us prioritize tasks effectively but also ensured we were consistently making progress towards our project goals.

To further refine our task prioritization process, we used a Trello Power-Up called "Card Priority." This allowed us to classify each task into one of four categories: Urgent and Important, Not Urgent but Important, Urgent and Not Important, and Not Urgent and Not Important. The level of importance was displayed on the front of each card, ensuring that our most critical tasks received immediate attention.

A unique checklist was created for each card, providing a detailed breakdown of the individual steps required to complete the task. As we progressed, we ticked off completed items, allowing us to track our progress in a granular way and ensuring nothing was missed.

Our use of Trello for this project was instrumental in keeping us organized, productive, and aligned with our project goals. It provided a visual snapshot of our project's status and allowed us to efficiently manage our tasks, leading to a streamlined and effective workflow.
