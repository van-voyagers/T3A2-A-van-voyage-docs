## Purpose:

The purpose of this application is to facilitate the operation of a hypothetical business that rents out a small fleet of vintage, refurbished camper-vans. It aims to provide a user-friendly platform where customers can conveniently book camper-vans and view their availability in real-time. The application is designed to cover new user registration, profile management, booking logs, availability tracking, and booking confirmation. It is intended to have an inbuilt review system, fostering a transparent and interactive space for customers to share their experiences.

The application is required to be scalable and extensible, built with the potential to integrate additional features or modules in the future, such as search filters, personalised recommendations, payment system, live chat messaging, admin dashboard and an instagram carousel.

<br>

## Target Audience:

The application's target audience is broad and inclusive, designed to cater to anyone with an interest in hiring vintage camper-vans. This could range from individuals planning a unique weekend getaway, families seeking an alternative vacation experience, to aficionados of vintage vehicles who relish the opportunity to experience these refurbished camper-vans.

While the application will be designed with ease of use in mind, it will cater to both tech-savvy users who are comfortable navigating digital platforms, and less tech-oriented individuals who may require a simpler, more intuitive user interface.
